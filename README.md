# Assigment

In this repo you can find my project assignment for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course

It contains four files: the README.md (Hey you are here now!), the run_analysis.r, the Codebook.txt and the tidyData.txt.

#run_analysis.r
This R script:
1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

In the script you can find comments that explain in detail the steps it takes.

Note: All the code for step 5 has been commented in order not to run. 

#Codebook.txt
Here you can find a description of all the variables.

#tidyData.txt
This is the output datafile that fulfills step 5.
